        <p>Butter chicken serves as a cornerstone of the worlds love for indian cuisine. 
            Enjoyed by many across the globe you'll be hard pressed to find an indian restaurant that doesn't serve this iconic dish. As it's so well loved,
             many have taken to making this dish at home. This is my favorite recipe to date. Its cheap, easy to make and still delicious.
        </p>
             
             <h3>The Origins Of Butter Chicken</h3>
              
             <p>
                Butter chicken originated from Northern India in 1948. Created by Kundan Lal Gujral, 
                you may notice that Butter Chicken (known as murgh makhani in Hindi â€” which translates to chicken with butter), 
                is similar to the British national dish chicken tikka masala.
              </p>

              <p>
                This dish is prepared in a buttery gravy and the addition of cream gives the curry sauce a silky smooth rich texture.
                 Most restaurants are known to add in copious amounts of butter,
                  which as a result can leave you feeling bloated or ill from the slick of grease.
              </p>

              <p>
              However, while recipe testing I found that replacing the butter for sauce with Ghee results in a lighter less rich sauce.
              </p>

              <p>
                Adding cream at the end of cooking provides enough of that richness you look for in an authentic butter chicken.
              </p>

             <h3>How Do We Make Butter Chicken</h3>
             
             <p>
                Butter chicken when compared to other Indian curries is a milder curry.
                 You can add as much or as little chili as you wish.
                 YOU are in total control of how spicy the dish is. 
             </p>

             <p>
                To make the tender, juicy and flavour infused chicken we need to make an easy yoghurt marinade using: 
                plain yoghurt, garam masala and salt.
             </p>

             <p>
                When it comes to the protein in this dish I prefer bone-in chicken thighs.
                 Any pieces of chicken will do but typically dark meat works better for this recipe.
            </p>
            <h3>Step by Step</h3>
           
            <ul>
            <li>First, mix your yogurt marinade together.</li>
            <li>Marinate chicken for 20 minutes, or overnight is preferable.
                 (The longer it marinates, the more tender your chicken will be.)</li>
            <li>Brown your chicken in a pan. Keep the charred brown bits from the chicken in the pan.
                 We call the charred bits fond. Fond adds flavour to any dish. 
                If the fond in your pan is burnt too much don't use it as burnt fond makes the dish bitter.</li>
            <li>Make your curry sauce in the same pan you browned the chicken in and let simmer.</li>
            <li>Finally add the chicken to the sauce and let simmer.</li>
           </ul>
           <h3>Vegan or Vegetarian Replacements</h3>
           <p>
            The butter in this recipe can be replaced with margarine 
            or an equal amount of vegetable oil. 
           </p>
           <p>
            Instead of heavy cream for this recipe you can use coconut cream for 
            a vegan replacement.
           </p>
           <p>
            And lastly maybe the most important part of the dish, the chicken. 
            The chicken can be replaced with tofu thats been marinated in the same yoghurt marinade meant for the chicken.
